# SEI PROJECT 1: PLANNING STAGE
___

### GAME CHOICE: CHECKERS

##### RULES OF CHECKERS:
- ###### WHO STARTS
  - First move is determined by a coin toss.
- ###### GAMEPLAY
  - Players move a checker piece each turn, with the objective of capturing all the opponent's pieces.
- ###### MOVEMENT
  - Normal pieces can only move <i>forward</i> diagonally.
  - If a normal piece reaches the first row on the opposite side of the board, that piece turns into a "King".
  - Once a piece becomes a "King", it can move forward and backward diagonally.
  - Pieces need to jump over an opponent's piece once encountered (have to be enforced)
  - Pieces can make multiple jumps over an opponent's piece if the moves are available in the same turn.
- ###### DETERMINING RESULTS
  - ##### WINNER
    - First player to capture all opponent's pieces
    - Last player to have made the last move if current player is no longer able to move.
  - ##### LOSER
    - All of player's pieces are captured
    - Player can no longer make a move. Diagonal areas to make moves are blocked by opponent.
  - ##### TIE
    - Both players can no longer move ?

##### (SOME) PLANNED APP FEATURES:
- As a player, having an option for a 2 player game or a game against a computer would be fun, because it give a more well-rounded gameplay experience.

- As a player, I would appreciate a day/night mode button toggle because it would be beneficial to me if I experience eye strain.
